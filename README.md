Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Victoria](http://www.groundwaterscienceandsustainability.org/) and the [Global Institute for Water Security](http://water.usask.ca/). 

My research focusses on characterizing groundwater systems within larger, more complex social-ecological systems. My goal is to identify critial relationships between environmental and social attributes and groundwater use, and to develop tools to support groundwater decision making that sustains groundwater resources, groundwater contributions to the environment, and groundwater-derived ecosystem services at regional to global scales.
