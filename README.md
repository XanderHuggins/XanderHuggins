Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD candidate at the University of Victoria and the Global Institute for Water Security. 

My research focusses on characterizing groundwater systems within larger, more complex social-ecological systems. My goal is to be able to identify environmental and social conditions that support sustainable groundwater use, and to develop tools for academics and decision-makers to support sustainable groundwater decision making at regional to global scales.
