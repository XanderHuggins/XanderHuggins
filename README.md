How does groundwater interact with social and ecological systems at large (regional to global scales)? <br><br>
How do these interactions exhibit behaviours of complex adaptive systems? <br><br>
How can groundwater sustainability be leveraged as a transformative process to underpin broader goals of social well-being, ecological integrity, social and environmental justice, and Earth system stability? <br><br>

These are the questions I'm interested in exploring.

I'm a NSERC and Killam Postdoctoral Research Fellow at UBC's IRES and a Postdoctoral Research Associate at Princeton's HMEI.
