Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a PhD candidate at the [University of Victoria](http://www.groundwaterscienceandsustainability.org/) and the [Global Institute for Water Security](http://water.usask.ca/). 

Here, you'll find a mix of repositories associated with manuscripts and personal data visualization projects. 

If you'd like to get in touch, you can reach me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/xander_huggins) or at <xanderhuggins@uvic.ca>. <br/>

And, if interested, here's a link to my [cv](https://xanderhuggins.github.io/cv/).
